How to cite us
==============
If you find CellRank useful for your research, please consider citing the CellRank manuscript :cite:`lange:22`.
In addition, if you used the :class:`cellrank.estimators.GPCCA` to compute initial, terminal or intermediate states,
please cite the GPCCA manuscript :cite:`reuter:18`. The :class:`cellrank.estimators.GPCCA` uses Generalized Perron
Cluster Cluster Analysis to coarse-grain cell-cell transition matrices into macrostates and an associated coarse-grained
transition matrix; it is implemented in the `pyGPCCA <https://pygpcca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ package
:cite:`reuter:22`.
