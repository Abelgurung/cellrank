About CellRank
===============



Why is it called "CellRank"?
----------------------------
CellRank **does not** rank cells, we gave the package this name because just like Google's original `PageRank`_
algorithm, it works with Markov chains to aggregate relationships between individual objects (cells vs. websites)
to learn about more global properties of the underlying dynamics (initial & terminal states and fate probabilities vs.
website relevance).
